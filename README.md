# Random-Poem-Generator
For my final project in Literature-Humanities, I've constructed a random poem generator using Milton's poem Paradise Lost. It currently only reads in Books 1 through 4, because God knows that's one long poem! I wrote this using a random number generator and some basic code in Java. Nonetheless, it was super fun and satisfying to see it generate random poems.
